				Back home in Hong Kong, Julian has served at The Vine Church. His main duties includeds running either audio and lighting. This is where Julian had his first step onto a digital console. The Allen & Heath iLive. He is a quick-learner and attentive to details and he was competent in no time.

				He also had first hands-on experience with a fully fledge lighting console, the Jands Vista. Being slightly different than other consoles, it took some time to get used to. Before he knew it, he was running audio and lighting at the same time for Sunday services.

				Outside Sunday services, there were external events that Julian was called in to help with. His knowledge of the venue has help external clients achieve the goals that they wanted to be done.
